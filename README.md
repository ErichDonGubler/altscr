# `dab`: "do in alternate buffer"

`dab` is a cross-platform command-line tool for running a command entirely
within an alternate screen buffer<sup>[1], [2]</sup>. Have you ever felt the
need to clear your terminal after running a particularly noisy command? Now, you
can quarantine the noise to an alternative screen buffer with `dab --
<command>`!
